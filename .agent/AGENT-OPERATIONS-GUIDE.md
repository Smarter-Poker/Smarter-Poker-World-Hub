# AGENT OPERATIONS GUIDE — read before touching anything

For every Claude agent (Cowork, CLI, Antigravity, subagents) on this platform.
Written 2026-08-19 after a session that hit every trap below and paid for it.
Companion to `.agent/SELF-PUBLISH-PROTOCOL.md` (push mechanics) and
`.agent/CLAUDE_AGENT_RULES.md` (RULES 1-12). If this file and reality
disagree, verify reality, then fix this file.

## 1. KNOW WHICH SHELL YOU ARE IN — the single biggest source of wasted time

| Shell | Where it runs | Network | Delete files | Repo access | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `counselors__host_terminal` | The Mac host, user smarter.poker | YES | YES | ~/Documents/* | push, publish, gh, locks cleanup, node |
| `device_bash` (Cowork VM) | Sandboxed Linux VM, repo mounts | NO | NO (`rm` fails) | /sessions/*/mnt/* | editing files, running node harnesses |
| `Bash` (cloud container) | Anthropic cloud sandbox | partial (proxy blocks github repos + smarter.poker) | YES | NO repo | npm lockfile work, Playwright renders |

- Host shells are NON-LOGIN: start anything needing node/gh with
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`. nvm also exists (~/.nvm).
- Host commands killed by the 60s MCP tool timeout KEEP RUNNING. Check
  `pgrep -f <script>` before starting a second copy. Run long jobs detached:
  `nohup <cmd> > /tmp/x.log 2>&1 &` and poll the log.
- On the VM, never fight a git lock by renaming it repeatedly -- 100+ stale
  `.lock.old` files accumulated that way. From the HOST:
  `find .git -name "*.lock*" -mmin +10 -delete`.
- The VM cannot run `next build` or `vite build` (arch-mismatched node_modules).
  Do not try. Typecheck with the repo's own tsc; build gates run on host/CI.

## 2. PUSH AND PUBLISH — never end a session unpushed, never hand off

Full mechanics in `.agent/SELF-PUBLISH-PROTOCOL.md`. Summary:
- World Hub: host shell -> clear stale locks -> ensure upstream
  (`git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main` if `git status -sb` shows a
  bare `## main`) -> `nohup bash scripts/git-safe-push.sh "msg" > /tmp/push-wh.log 2>&1 &`
  -> poll for DEPLOY_VERIFIED:true and SHA_MATCHED:true.
- Club Arena: if origin moved and the tree holds another agent's uncommitted
  files, merge in a THROWAWAY WORKTREE (never stash their files):
  `git worktree add --detach /tmp/ca-merge origin/main; cd /tmp/ca-merge;
  git merge --no-edit main; ln -sfn ~/Documents/club-arena/node_modules node_modules;
  ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json; git push origin HEAD:main;`
  then remove the worktree. Pushing CA main triggers: CI, Silent Revert Guard,
  Build for World Hub Sync (publishes arena assets), Auto-Deploy Hetzner Engine
  (server/ changes go LIVE on the game engine). Verify ALL of them:
  `gh run list --repo Smarter-Poker/Smarter-Poker-Club-Arena --limit 5`.
  A red run = not published. Fix forward the same session.
- Vercel needs nothing manual (GitHub integration deploys on push). Verify
  READY on the expected commit via the Vercel MCP, then content-check.

## 3. CREDENTIALS — where things actually are (post-rotation, 2026-08-19)

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: valid tokens live in `Smarter-Poker-World-Hub/.env.local`
  and `club-arena/.env` (sourced from the Vercel CLI session, verified against
  the API). If one ever 401s again, the CLI session at `~/Library/Application
  Support/com.vercel.cli/auth.json` on the host is the source of truth.
- Supabase: NEW-format keys (`sb_secret_...`, `sb_publishable_...`) in
  `WH/.env.local` and `CA/.env`. Legacy JWT-format keys are REVOKED --
  placeholders marked `<REVOKED-2026-08-16-...>` are intentional, leave them.
  Server work goes through the Supabase MCP when available (project
  kuklfnapbkmacvwxktbh); it needs no local key.
- GitHub: the host's git remotes and `gh` CLI are already authenticated --
  just use them from host_terminal. Do NOT copy tokens into new files, do NOT
  print token values into chat/logs, ever. `GH_PAT`/`AUTOFIX_GITHUB_TOKEN`/
  `NPM_TOKEN` placeholders marked `<ROTATED-2026-08-16>` are intentional.
- Hetzner: SSH keys exist ONLY as GitHub Actions secrets (write-only). WH
  workflows use `HETZNER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`; CA workflows use `HETZNER_SSH_KEY`.
  Rotations must update BOTH names in BOTH repos' Settings -> Secrets.
- `.env.example` files contain intentional placeholders that 401. Never
  "fix" them with real values -- they are committed and public.

## 4. VERIFY AGAINST REALITY, NOT AGAINST FILES — the recurring lesson

Every serious incident this month traces to trusting a stale artifact:
- MIGRATION FILES LIE. Before touching a live DB function, diff against
  `pg_get_functiondef()` on production. A drafted "fix" for atomic_table_buyin
  based on the last migration file would have reverted three later security
  gates and broken every buy-in (uuid vs text). The live definition is truth.
- THE SCHEMA MANIFEST GOES STALE. CI "phantom RPC" failures usually mean the
  manifest lags production, not that the code is wrong. Check pg_proc first;
  regenerate with `node scripts/ci/gen-schema-manifest.mjs` (CA repo, needs
  SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from CA/.env).
- A REPORTED SHA IS NOT A DEPLOY. Prove pushes on content:
  `git show origin/main:<file> | grep <symbol>`. A coordinator once reported
  "deployed" while origin had not moved.
- A BACKGROUNDED CHROME TAB STOPS requestAnimationFrame COMPLETELY. Every
  framer-motion animation freezes and AnimatePresence mode="wait" phase
  switches never mount -- "Start Training" looks dead when it is fine.
  Foreground the tab and assert rAF ticks before believing any screenshot.
- BACKLOG ITEMS GO STALE. Two "known gaps" (streaks wiring, training_answers
  columns) were already fixed when an agent went to fix them. grep the code
  and query the DB before starting work someone described weeks ago.

## 5. THE HOUSE BUG SHAPE — hunt it in every audit

Nearly every real defect found across 60+ fixes was a SILENT FALLBACK MASKING
A FAILURE: `|| 0` where 0 is also a valid seat index; `|| 'hero'` on a missing
lookup; `?? 0` colliding with fold's real EV; `|| 6` inventing a pot;
`|| 1.5` inventing another; one enum value covering two different poker
situations; hero-relative tables indexed with absolute indices (FOUR separate
shipped defects); `catch {}` swallowing and guessing; a fail-OPEN cap check
returning [] on DB error. When auditing, grep for these shapes first. When
writing code: unknown stays unknown, caps fail closed, never render a guess.

## 6. CONCURRENCY — several agents share these repos at once

- NEVER `git add -A` / `git add .` -- it has swallowed other agents'
  half-finished work repeatedly. Stage explicit paths you personally edited.
- Re-read `git status` immediately before every commit.
- When origin moved under you: MERGE, do not rebase (rebasing under
  concurrent writers churns SHAs and broke handoffs twice).
- Never stash or revert another agent's dirty files; use the worktree pattern.
- Commit early and often -- Antigravity's `git reset --hard origin/main`
  destroys uncommitted work AND unpushed local-only commits. If you must stop
  with unpushed work, `git bundle create .agent/backup-<date>.bundle
  origin/main..HEAD` first (untracked files survive resets).

## 7. HOUSE RULES QUICK LIST

- No emoji in source, data rows, or commit messages. Approved glyphs:
  suits and the set in TRAINING-UI-SPEC. Three deliberate exceptions where
  emoji ARE the payload: EmojiThrower.jsx, ThrowableEmojis.jsx, and the
  reaction arrays in LivePokerTable.jsx.
- API routes: `getServerUserWithFallback` from serverAuth -- never authUtils
  (client-only, breaks server auth), never raw supabase.auth.getUser (hook
  blocks it; note the hook's own error message wrongly says authUtils).
- `.maybeSingle()` never `.single()`. No raw supabase-js imports in API routes.
- Migrations via Supabase MCP `apply_migration` (auditable), mirrored into
  supabase/migrations/ EXACTLY as applied. Data-shape rule: sole-value fields
  (icon:'x') get remapped, inline decorations get deleted -- blanking a
  sole-value field ships an empty UI slot.
- Run the harnesses before committing anything they cover; they are cheap and
  they have caught real regressions: WH `scripts/*-check.js` +
  `engine-correctness-harness.js`; CA `scripts/multi-table-check.js` +
  `server/src/*.test.ts`. Never loosen an assertion to make it pass.
- Protected zone: `public/hub/club-arena/` in WH is build output -- never
  hand-edit; commit messages touching it must contain "club-arena".

## 8. REAL-BROWSER E2E — run before claiming UI work done

File-level checks, harnesses and even deployed-chunk greps prove the CODE
shipped; only a real browser proves the FLOW works. Run the relevant
production walkthrough and read its PASS/FAIL lines + screenshots BEFORE
reporting any user-facing work as complete.

- Scripts live in club-arena `e2e-live/` (plain playwright, standalone; see
  its README for the selector map and hard-won rules). Run from the HOST:
  `SP_EMAIL=... SP_PASS=... bash scripts/e2e-host.sh multitable-walk`
  (or `trainer-walkthrough`, which covers the World Hub trainer surface).
- Supabase refresh tokens are SINGLE-USE: saved auth state goes stale after
  one reuse. The scripts re-save it every run and fall back to credential
  login — keep that behavior in anything new.
- Screenshots land in /tmp/e2e-shots. To LOOK at them (mandatory for visual
  claims): cp into a device-mounted folder, stage via device_stage_files,
  then Read the staged path.
- A run that fails can be a PRODUCT bug, a TEST bug, or a PLATFORM incident —
  check https://status.supabase.com before debugging your own code (the
  2026-08-20 API Gateway degradation produced infinite club-home skeletons
  that looked exactly like an app bug).
