# 🛡️ Social Media Protection & Development Guide

> **🚨 CRITICAL**: This skill documents ALL working features in the social hub. Before making ANY change to social-media.js or related files, you MUST verify all features still work after your changes.

## Why This Exists

The social media page (`/hub/social-media.js`) is a 2700+ line file with 60+ functions that powers the entire social experience. It has been broken and rebuilt MULTIPLE times. Small changes have catastrophic consequences.

## Common Breakages & How to Avoid

### The Article Reader Pattern

```javascript
// ❌ BREAKS IT - removes the modal handler
<PostCard post={p} />

// ✅ CORRECT - passes the modal handler
<PostCard 
    post={p} 
    onOpenArticle={(url, title) => setArticleReader({ open: true, url, title })} 
/>
```

### The FK Join Pattern

```javascript
// ❌ BREAKS IT - crashes on null profile
const author = authorMap[post.author_id].username;

// ✅ CORRECT - handles null gracefully
const author = authorMap[post.author_id]?.username || 'Player';
```

### The Filter Pattern

```javascript
// ❌ BREAKS IT - silently removes items
items.filter(item => item.profile);

// ✅ CORRECT - keeps with fallback
items.map(item => ({ ...item, profile: item.profile || DEFAULT }));
```
