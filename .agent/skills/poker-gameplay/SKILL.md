### 4. ACTION SYSTEM

#### Available Actions
| Action   | When Available                    | Effect                              |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Fold     | Always                           | Forfeit hand, exit                  |
| Check    | No bet active in current round   | Pass without betting                |
| Call     | Bet/raise exists                 | Match highest bet                   |
| Bet      | First action, no existing bet    | Initiate bet (min = BB)             |
| Raise    | Bet/raise exists                 | Increase bet (min = previous raise) |
| All-In   | Always                           | Commit entire remaining stack       |

#### Minimum Raise Rules
- Minimum raise = size of the PREVIOUS raise (not the previous bet)
- Example: Player A bets $10, Player B raises to $30 (raise of $20)
  Player C must raise by at least $20 more (minimum raise to $50)
- If a player doesn't have enough for minimum raise, they can only call or go all-in

#### All-In & Side Pots
- When player goes all-in with fewer chips than others:
  - Main pot capped at all-in player's contribution x number of callers
  - Remaining bets go into side pot(s)
  - All-in player can only win main pot
- Multiple all-ins create multiple side pots
- Each pot awarded to best hand among ELIGIBLE players for that pot

#### Action Timer
- Standard: 15-30 seconds per action
- When timer expires: auto-fold (if bet to call) or auto-check (if check available)
- Time Bank: extra 15-60 second reserve, activates automatically when main timer expires
- Time bank is limited per session (not per hand)

#### Pre-Action Buttons (shown when NOT your turn)
- Check/Fold: auto-fold if bet comes, auto-check if no bet
- Call Any: auto-call any bet
- These queue actions for when it's your turn

### 5. UI/UX ELEMENTS - WHAT MUST RENDER

#### Card Display
- **Hero hole cards**: Large, face-up, prominent position at bottom of table
- **Opponent hole cards**: Face-down (card back design), NEVER visible until showdown
- **Community cards**: 5 positions in center, revealed progressively (3 flop, +1 turn, +1 river)
- **Winning hand**: Cards highlighted at showdown, hand name displayed

#### Player Seat Display (per player)
- Player name/username
- Chip stack amount (formatted with commas, K/M for large amounts)
- Avatar/profile image
- Current bet amount (shown near player's position)
- Status: Active, Folded (grayed out), All-In (highlighted), Sitting Out
- Position badge: D (dealer), SB, BB

#### Table Center Display
- **Pot amount**: Always visible, updates with each action
- **Side pots**: Labeled separately when applicable
- **Community cards**: Center row of 5 card positions
- **Dealer button**: Visual chip at dealer's seat

#### Action Panel (shown only when it's hero's turn)
- **Fold** button (red)
- **Check/Call** button (green) - shows amount to call
- **Raise** button with slider (amber) - min/max range, preset buttons (1/3 pot, 1/2 pot, 3/4 pot, pot)
- **All-In** button
- **Timer countdown** visible at hero's seat

#### Turn Indicator
- Active player's seat highlighted/glowing
- Timer countdown at active player's seat

#### Win Animation
- Pot chips animate flowing to winner
- Winning hand name displayed ("Full House, Aces over Kings")
- Cards highlighted
- Brief pause (2-3 seconds) before next hand

### 6. POT CALCULATION

#### Simple (No All-Ins)
- All bets from all streets accumulate into single pot
- Winner takes pot minus rake

#### Side Pots (With All-Ins)
Example: Player A has 50, Player B has 100, Player C has 200
- All contribute to main pot up to smallest stack: 50 x 3 = 150 (A, B, C eligible)
- B and C continue: (100-50) x 2 = 100 in Side Pot 1 (B, C eligible)
- C alone: remaining goes to Side Pot 2 (returned to C if uncalled)
- Best hand among eligible players wins each pot separately

### 7. RAKE SYSTEM

- **Rate**: 2.5-5% of pot (Club Arena uses configurable rates per blind level)
- **Cap**: Maximum rake per hand (e.g., $3 for 1/2, $12.50 for 5/10)
- **No-Flop-No-Drop**: If hand ends before flop, ZERO rake collected
- **Timing**: Rake deducted at hand completion, before pot distribution
- **Display**: Show rake amount to players after hand

### 8. BAD BEAT JACKPOT (BBJ)

- **Contribution**: Taken from each raked pot (typically 1 BB from pots >= 30 BB)
- **Pool**: Accumulates until qualifying bad beat occurs
- **Qualification**: Very strong losing hand (e.g., quad 8s+ losing to better hand)
- **Payout**: Typically 50% loser, 25% winner, 25% table
- **Both hole cards** must play in qualifying hands

### 9. BETWEEN HANDS

1. Pot awarded to winner(s) with animation
2. Rake amount displayed
3. Brief pause (2-3 seconds)
4. Dealer button rotates clockwise
5. New hand auto-starts (no player action needed)
6. All active players automatically in next hand
7. Players can "Sit Out" between hands
8. Auto-rebuy available if configured

### 10. PLAYER LEAVING (Cash Out)

- Can leave between hands only (not mid-hand)
- Chip stack converted back to wallet balance
- Transaction logged in chip_ledger
- Seat becomes available immediately
- Waiting list player offered the seat

## TOURNAMENT DIFFERENCES

### Structure
- Fixed buy-in gives tournament chips (non-redeemable)
- All players start with equal stacks
- Blinds increase on timed schedule (e.g., every 15 min online)
- Late registration window (first N levels)
- Table balancing as players bust (move players to equalize tables)
- Payout structure: top X% of field

### Formats
- **Freezeout**: No rebuys, bust = eliminated
- **Rebuy**: Can rebuy during rebuy period
- **Re-Entry**: Pay full buy-in again, seated at new table
- **Bounty/KO**: Prize for each player eliminated

### Key Differences from Cash
- Cannot leave with chips (must play until bust or win)
- No auto-rebuy (unless rebuy period active)
- Blind levels increase over time
- Players eliminated as they lose all chips

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Client-Server Model
- **Server is AUTHORITATIVE** for all game state
- Server maintains: deck, player stacks, cards, pot, action order
- Clients are rendering terminals that display server state
- All actions validated server-side before execution

### Card Security
- Server NEVER sends opponent hole cards to any client
- Each client only receives its own hole cards
- Opponent cards sent ONLY at showdown
- Shuffling uses cryptographically secure RNG on server

### Communication
- Supabase Realtime broadcast channels for state updates
- Channel: `hand-state:{tableId}` for game state broadcasts
- Client sends actions via HTTP POST to game server
- Server validates, processes, broadcasts new state

### State Updates
- Server broadcasts after: HAND_START, CARDS_DEALT, PLAYER_ACTION, COMMUNITY_CARDS, WINNERS, HAND_COMPLETE
- Client receives broadcast, updates UI accordingly
- Turn timer managed server-side, synced to client

### Verified Working (from audit)
- Hand dealing (correct card counts per variant)
- Betting logic (check/call/bet/raise/fold/all-in)
- Action order (UTG first preflop, SB first postflop, heads-up rules)
- Pot calculation including side pots
- Hand evaluation (all rankings, Omaha support)
- Winner determination (multi-way, split pots, hi-lo)
- Rake calculation (percentage, caps, no-flop-no-drop)
- Next hand auto-start (3 sec delay, dealer rotation)
- Horse bot decisions (5 styles, position-aware)
- Hand history recording and persistence

### Known Issues (from audit)
1. **No seat selection UI** - Players can't visually choose a seat
2. **Client-side dealing only** - Server engine runs independently, not coordinated
3. **Timer shows on horse turns** - Should be hidden for bot actions
4. **Pot display briefly stale after showdown** - Minor visual glitch
