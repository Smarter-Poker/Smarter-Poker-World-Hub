# guard-merged-branch.sh — a push onto a branch whose pull request already
# merged is work that VANISHES, and git reports it as success.
#
# ── WHAT HAPPENED, 2026-09-06 ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Three commits were pushed to `chore/public-sheds-its-dead-weight` in the World
# Hub. One of them reached `main`.
#
#   1. commit 1 pushed          -> agent-open-pr.yml opens PR #1387
#   2. required checks go green -> agent-autopilot.yml squash-merges it,
#                                  at head 93033afb1, `commits: 1`
#   3. commits 2 and 3 pushed   -> the branch updates, the PR is CLOSED,
#                                  nothing merges, nothing complains
#
# `git push` exited 0. The pull request read "Merged". The branch on GitHub
# genuinely contained all three commits. Every signal an agent normally checks
# said the work had landed, and two commits - a CI fix for a gate that had been
# red on main for two days, and the deletion of a component that fabricated
# player data - simply were not there.
#
# It was found only by asking whether the FILES were on main. That is the habit
# CLAUDE.md 1.4/1.5 already demands for deploys ("only production serving the
# sha counts"), and it turns out to apply to merges too.
#
# ── WHY IT IS EASY TO HIT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Autopilot merges the moment the required checks pass, which on a docs-heavy
# or asset-only change can be under two minutes. Any agent that pushes, keeps
# working, and pushes again - the normal shape of a session - is racing it. The
# faster CI gets, the more often this fires.
#
# ── WHAT THIS DOES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Before the push, ask GitHub what happened to the pull request for this
# branch. If it is MERGED or CLOSED, refuse, and say exactly what to do
# instead: a new branch. Nothing is lost and nothing is force-pushed.
#
# FAILS OPEN, deliberately. No token, no network, an API error, an unexpected
# response - all of them warn and allow. A hook that blocks work when GitHub is
# unreachable is a worse bug than the one it prevents. It only ever refuses on
# a definite, positive answer.
#
# Bypass, when you genuinely mean to add to a merged branch (a backup ref, say):
#   AGENT_MERGED_BRANCH_OK=1 git push ...

# Token: `gh` first (it is not installed on this Mac, but a CI box may have it),
# then .env.
#
# THE .env IS NOT IN THE WORKTREE. Every agent works in `git worktree add`
# checkouts under .agent-trees/, and .env is gitignored, so it exists ONLY in
# the primary clone. Looking at `--show-toplevel` finds nothing and the guard
# silently fails open - which is exactly how the first version of this file did
# nothing at all. `--git-common-dir` points at the primary clone's .git for
# every linked worktree, so its parent is the one directory guaranteed to have
# the .env.
# THE KEY IS NOT CALLED THE SAME THING IN BOTH REPOS (found 2026-09-06, the
# hard way). Club Arena's .env has GITHUB_TOKEN; the World Hub's has
# GITHUB_PAT_FINE_GRAINED and no GITHUB_TOKEN at all. The first version of this
# guard looked for one name, found nothing in the World Hub, and failed open on
# every single push - installed, running, and silent. It let a second lost-commit
# incident through within the hour, which is how it was noticed.
#
# So try every name either repo actually uses, and the environment first.
