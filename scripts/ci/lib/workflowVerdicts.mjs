/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A SKIPPED RUN IS NOT A GREEN RUN
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `check-main-is-green.mjs` grouped every completed run on `main` by workflow,
 * took the newest one, and reported the workflow only when THAT run had
 * `conclusion === 'failure'`. Its own success line said the quiet part:
 *
 *     "OK - every workflow's latest run on main is green or neutral."
 *
 * Neutral was being counted as health. It is not health, it is the absence of
 * evidence, and the two are only the same when nothing ever skips.
 *
 * ── MEASURED, 2026-09-09, IN BOTH REPOS ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Club Arena: `Post-Deploy E2E (production)` had failed **24 times in 21 hours
 * with no success at all** and the detector had never once named it. It is a
 * `workflow_run` listener with a concurrency group, so most of its runs end
 * `skipped` (the publish it listens for concluded something other than success)
 * or `cancelled` (a newer run took the lock). In a 300-run window it had 46
 * runs, of which **7 carried a verdict and all 7 were failures** - and the
 * newest run, the only one the detector read, was `cancelled`.
 *
 * Here: `Push Delivery Watchdog` was masked the same way - latest run
 * `cancelled`, with a failed verdict sitting directly behind it. Fixing the
 * detector in one repo and not the other would leave the estate's two copies
 * disagreeing about what red means, which is its own defect.
 *
 * That is not a tuning problem. Any workflow whose runs interleave skips with
 * failures is STRUCTURALLY invisible to "is the newest run a failure", and
 * event-driven workflows interleave by construction. The consecutive-failure
 * walk had the same hole one line further down: it `break`s on any non-failure,
 * so a single skip between two failures reset the clock to zero and put the
 * workflow back under the threshold.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only a run that reached a VERDICT is evidence about a workflow's health.
 * `success` says green. `failure`, `timed_out` and `startup_failure` say red -
 * the last two were also invisible before, because only the literal string
 * 'failure' counted. `skipped`, `cancelled`, `neutral`, `action_required` and
 * `stale` say nothing at all, and are stepped over rather than believed.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DURATION SAYS "AT LEAST" ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The caller reads a fixed window of recent runs. A noisy workflow can fill it
 * on its own - Post-Deploy E2E was 46 of 300 - so the oldest failure visible is
 * often not the first one. When the walk consumes every verdict in the window
 * without finding a success, the true duration is longer than measured, and the
 * report says so instead of quoting a number it cannot support. It errs toward
 * under-reporting, never toward a louder alarm than the evidence carries.
