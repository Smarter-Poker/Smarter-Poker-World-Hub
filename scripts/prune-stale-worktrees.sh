# prune-stale-worktrees.sh — remove agent worktrees whose work is safely on
# origin, so stale trees stop re-fighting settled wars.
#
# Ported to the World Hub 2026-09-05. It existed only in the Club Arena repo,
# and the World Hub's worktrees are the LARGER ones - measured that day, the
# Mac was at 239 MiB free of 926 GiB, with single World Hub trees at 5.1 GB and
# 4.7 GB (each carries a full node_modules AND, until this same commit, 632 MB
# of public/). Running the Club Arena copy reclaimed 16 GB; nothing had ever
# been able to touch the World Hub's.
#
# Added 2026-09-01 (cost + regression audit). That machine had 381 worktrees
# of Club Arena, median ~800 commits behind main. Stale trees carry stale
# CLAUDE.md laws, and agents reading them re-revert current work — that is
# exactly how the hamburger-menu revert war (#2321/#2401/#2429/#2432)
# sustained itself for two days. They also each hold a full node_modules.
#
# A worktree is removed ONLY when ALL of these hold:
#   1. `git status --porcelain` is empty (nothing uncommitted), and
#   2. its HEAD is reachable from some remote ref (the branch was pushed —
#      the commits live on origin whatever happens to this directory), and
#   3. its last commit is older than IDLE_HOURS (default 72).
#
# Anything else is REPORTED, never touched, and `git worktree remove` without
# --force is the final safety: it refuses a dirty tree even if the checks
# above were wrong. Nothing is ever deleted with rm.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/prune-stale-worktrees.sh --dry-run     # report only
#   bash scripts/prune-stale-worktrees.sh               # prune
#   IDLE_HOURS=168 bash scripts/prune-stale-worktrees.sh

  # 2. Is this work safely on origin?
  #
  # THE FAST PATH: HEAD reachable from a remote ref. Correct, but it only ever
  # answers "yes" for a branch that was merged with a MERGE COMMIT.
  #
  # THIS REPO SQUASH-MERGES. A squash lands the CONTENT on main under a brand
  # new SHA, and the branch's own commits are never ancestors of main, so
  # `branch -r --contains` is empty forever for work that shipped weeks ago.
  # Every one of those worktrees was therefore filed "unpushed!" and kept for
  # good. Measured 2026-09-02: of 62 worktrees this check called unpushed,
  # 54 were already upstream in full and only 8 held anything new. That is
  # the whole reason the worktree count only ever grows, and why this machine
  # reached 92% full with ~110 GB of duplicated node_modules.
  #
  # THE SLOW PATH, only when the fast one says no: `git cherry` compares
  # PATCH IDs rather than SHAs, so it recognises a squashed commit by its
  # content. It prints '-' for a commit that already has an equivalent
  # upstream and '+' for one that does not. Zero '+' lines means every commit
  # here is already on main under another SHA - safe to prune.
  #
  # This can only ever move a worktree from KEEP to PRUNE when git itself says
  # the content is upstream. A branch with even one genuinely new commit still
  # takes the loud KEEP below, and `git worktree remove` without --force
  # remains the final refusal.
