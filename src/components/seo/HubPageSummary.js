   HUB PAGE SUMMARY - the words a crawler reads on a hub product page
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   AEO PHASE 3 (2026-09-17). The World Hub publishes about thirty /hub routes
   in the sitemap at priority 0.7 to 0.9. Measured on production, with every
   script stripped, most of them were navigation chrome and nothing else:

       /hub                      31 words, NO heading at all
       /hub/bankroll-manager     51 words
       /hub/home-games           59 words
       /hub/poker-near-me/lobby  78 words

   Googlebot runs JavaScript and eventually sees the app. The crawlers that
   decide what ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and Meta AI may cite do not, and
   Bing does not at scale. To all of them these pages said nothing, which is
   the same hole scripts/prerender-public-routes.mjs closed for Club Arena.

   This is the same answer the landing page already uses
   (src/components/landing/LandingProductSummary.js): real page content,
   rendered on the server, that says what the page is and links the routes
   under it. It is NOT hidden text. Hidden text is a spam signal; this copy
   is meant to be read, sits at the end of the page in the normal flow, and
   uses the page's own type and colours.

   Copy follows the house rule: Title Case, no em dashes
   (scripts/ci/check-title-case.mjs, scripts/ci/check-ui-text.mjs). Keep the
   definitions in step with LandingProductSummary: an AI engine repeats the
   definition it sees most often, so the two must not drift.
