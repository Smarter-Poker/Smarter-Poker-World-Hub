## ✅ WHAT REAL POKER PLAYERS ACTUALLY POST

Based on deep research of r/chipporn, poker Twitter, and professional player 
Instagram accounts:

### 1. CHIP AUTHENTICITY (Critical - v1.1)
- **REAL CASINO BRANDING** - Chips from actual casinos: Bellagio, Aria, Wynn, MGM, Venetian, WSOP
- **VISIBLE DENOMINATIONS** - $1 white, $5 red, $25 green, $100 black, $500 purple clearly marked
- **NEATLY STACKED** - Chips organized in clean stacks of 20
- **SORTED BY DENOMINATION** - Colors separated and organized
- **REALISTIC SESSION AMOUNTS** - Pile size matches a believable session (not ridiculous towers)

### 2. HOME GAME CHIPS (Alternative)
- **CERAMIC CHIPS** - Monte Carlo style, Paulson clays, or quality home game sets
- **PRINTED DENOMINATIONS** - Clear value markings on chips
- **NOT GENERIC** - Must look like quality poker chips, not plain colored discs

### 2. CARD PRESENTATION
- **Hole cards from POV** - Looking down at your own cards (AA, KK, etc.)
- **Cards next to board** - Showing hand vs community cards after showdown
- **Face-up reveals** - Cards properly positioned on felt
- **Never floating or scattered** - Always laying flat on felt

### 3. TABLE & ENVIRONMENT
- **Green felt** - Standard casino felt, clean
- **Dealer button visible** - Legitimate poker indicator
- **Proper table layout** - Rail, felt, betting areas
- **Other player positions** - Blurred hands/chips in background
- **Overhead lighting** - Casino-style bright lights on tables

### 4. CASINO/VENUE ATMOSPHERE
- **Poker room wide shots** - Rows of organized tables
- **Cashier cage** - Chip racks, money counters
- **Casino carpet patterns** - Distinctive venue flooring
- **Overhead fluorescent lights** - Standard casino lighting
- **Dealers in uniform** - Professional attire

### 5. LIFESTYLE ELEMENTS (Authentic)
- **Coffee cups** - Real ceramic mugs or paper cups
- **Water bottles** - Brands visible, condensation
- **Food in background** - Casino cafe trays, not centerpiece
- **Phones/tablets edge of frame** - Modern player accessories

### 6. HOME GAME AESTHETICS
- **Folding table or nice poker table** - Not a kitchen table
- **Chips properly organized** - Not scattered randomly
- **Beer bottles/cans** - Standard home game fare
- **Warm lamp lighting** - Residential vs casino
- **Friends visible** - Real people, not AI faces

## ❌ DEAD GIVEAWAYS OF AI-GENERATED POKER IMAGES

- ❌ **Chips in "chaos"** - This literally never happens
- ❌ **RIDICULOUS PILE SIZES** - Unrealistic tower of chips without context

- ❌ **Golden hour glow** - Casinos don't have windows
- ❌ **Lens flares** - Phone photos don't have this
- ❌ **HDR overprocessing** - Too vibrant, too saturated
- ❌ **Movie-poster composition** - Too perfect framing

### 5. ATMOSPHERE RED FLAGS
