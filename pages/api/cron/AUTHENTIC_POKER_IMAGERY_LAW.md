## ✅ WHAT REAL POKER PLAYERS ACTUALLY POST

Based on deep research of r/chipporn, poker Twitter, and professional player 
Instagram accounts:

### 1. CHIP PRESENTATION (Critical)
- **NEATLY STACKED** - Chips organized in clean stacks of 20
- **SORTED BY DENOMINATION** - Colors separated and organized
- **CHIP CASTLES/TOWERS** - Tall, carefully built formations
- **CHIP RACKS** - Casino chip carriers with organized rows
- **Player's personal area** - Their spot on the table, neat and organized

### 2. CARD PRESENTATION
- **Hole cards from POV** - Looking down at your own cards (AA, KK, etc.)
- **Cards next to board** - Showing hand vs community cards after showdown
- **Face-up reveals** - Cards properly positioned on felt
- **Never floating or scattered** - Always laying flat on felt

### 3. TABLE & ENVIRONMENT
- **Green felt** - Standard casino felt, clean
- **Dealer button visible** - Legitimate poker indicator
- **Proper table layout** - Rail, felt, betting areas
- **Other player positions** - Blurred hands/chips in background
- **Overhead lighting** - Casino-style bright lights on tables

### 4. CASINO/VENUE ATMOSPHERE
- **Poker room wide shots** - Rows of organized tables
- **Cashier cage** - Chip racks, money counters
- **Casino carpet patterns** - Distinctive venue flooring
- **Overhead fluorescent lights** - Standard casino lighting
- **Dealers in uniform** - Professional attire

### 5. LIFESTYLE ELEMENTS (Authentic)
- **Coffee cups** - Real ceramic mugs or paper cups
- **Water bottles** - Brands visible, condensation
- **Food in background** - Casino cafe trays, not centerpiece
- **Phones/tablets edge of frame** - Modern player accessories

### 6. HOME GAME AESTHETICS
- **Folding table or nice poker table** - Not a kitchen table
- **Chips properly organized** - Not scattered randomly
- **Beer bottles/cans** - Standard home game fare
- **Warm lamp lighting** - Residential vs casino
- **Friends visible** - Real people, not AI faces

## ❌ DEAD GIVEAWAYS OF AI-GENERATED POKER IMAGES

- ❌ **BACCARAT TABLE** - Long oval, different chip placement
- ❌ **ROULETTE** - Round wheel, completely wrong
- ❌ **CRAPS** - Rectangular with side rails
- ❌ **ANY NON-POKER TABLE** - Must be poker table only

### 1. CHIP PRESENTATION (Instant Detection)
- ❌ **SCATTERED CHIPS** - Nobody scatters their chips

- ❌ **RANDOM PILES** - Chaos = AI, organization = human
- ❌ **Chips in "chaos"** - This literally never happens

### 2. CARD ISSUES

### 3. HAND/BODY ISSUES

- ❌ **Missing fingers** - Common AI artifact
- ❌ **Distorted hands** - Weird proportions
- ❌ **Uncanny valley faces** - Almost-human players

### 4. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
- ❌ **Dramatic cinematic lighting** - Real casinos have flat lighting
- ❌ **Golden hour glow** - Casinos don't have windows
- ❌ **Lens flares** - Phone photos don't have this
- ❌ **HDR overprocessing** - Too vibrant, too saturated
- ❌ **Movie-poster composition** - Too perfect framing

### 5. ATMOSPHERE RED FLAGS
- ❌ **Empty casino with perfect lighting** - Casinos are crowded/dim
- ❌ **Steam rising from drinks** - Too artistic
- ❌ **Glowing chips** - Chips don't emit light
- ❌ **Dramatic shadows** - Flat casino lighting doesn't do this
