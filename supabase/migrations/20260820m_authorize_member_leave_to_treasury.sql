-- SEC-3 (2026-08-20): fn_member_leave_to_treasury had NO authorization check.
--
-- It is SECURITY DEFINER, granted to `authenticated`, and takes an arbitrary
-- (p_club_id, p_user_id). Any logged-in user could therefore evict ANY member
-- from ANY club and sweep that member's club chip_balance into the club
-- treasury -- chip movement plus forced removal, with the victim's own user id
-- recorded as the source in chip_transactions.
--
-- Its sibling treasury functions (fn_horse_seat_from_treasury,
-- fn_horse_fund_from_treasury) already gate on
-- fn_actor_can_manage_club_treasury(); this one was simply missed. Both were
-- reviewed during this audit and are correctly guarded, as is that helper
-- (service role, club owner, admin-tier member, or agent).
--
-- Guard added: the caller must be the service role, OR the member themselves
-- (the real client flow -- ClubsService.leaveClub passes the caller's own user
-- id), OR someone who can manage that club's treasury. Everything else in the
-- function is byte-identical.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'authorize_member_leave_to_treasury'.
