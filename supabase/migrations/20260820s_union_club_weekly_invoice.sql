-- THE WEEKLY CLUB INVOICE (2026-08-20)
--
-- One number per club per week: what the club owes the union, or the union
-- owes the club, with every component shown so it can be argued with.
--
-- Until now the pieces existed but nobody could see them together: the player
-- P&L settlement moved chips, the 90/10 rakeback close moved chips, ECO was
-- new, and presettlements were new. A club could not be handed a single
-- statement.
--
-- CRITICAL DISTINCTION, made explicit in the output so nothing is ever paid
-- twice:
--   * settled_in_chips  = player P&L + rakeback. These ALREADY move
--     automatically (Monday settlement + the engine's weekly 90/10 close).
--     They are shown for transparency, not as something to pay again.
--   * outstanding       = ECO + presettlements. ECO is an invoice adjustment
--     with NO auto-distribution (Dan's rule); presettlements are cash the club
--     has already sent. This is the number that actually needs squaring up.
--
-- Rake schedule is untouched. No late fees anywhere.
--
-- BUG FIXED IMMEDIATELY AFTER FIRST WRITE: presettlements were filtered with a
-- half-open window [v_start, v_end). For the normal call v_end = now(), and
-- because now() is constant within a transaction, a presettlement received at
-- that instant -- including one recorded in the same transaction -- fell
-- outside `< v_end` and was silently dropped, so a club that had just paid was
-- invoiced as if it had not. The filter now matches fn_union_club_exposure
-- exactly: unapplied cash from v_start onward, closed out by
-- applied_settlement_id rather than by the clock, so the two functions can
-- never disagree and nothing is double-counted across periods.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'union_club_weekly_invoice' then
-- 'fix_invoice_presettlement_boundary'; this file is the final state.
