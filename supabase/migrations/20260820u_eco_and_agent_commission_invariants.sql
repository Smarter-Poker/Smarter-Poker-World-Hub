-- Extend the credit-risk sweep with ECO and agent-commission invariants.
-- Same return type as the version added earlier today, so it slots into the
-- governance sweep already appended by 20260820p with no further rewrite.
--
-- Both new checks are bounded to the current settlement week and to the small
-- agented population (184 club_members across 11 agents, 3.3k rollup rows), so
-- they are safe at the 30-minute engine cadence. The ECO check costs nothing
-- while ECO is disabled. Measured governance sweep after: 1.55s.
--
-- FIRST RUN FOUND A REAL PROBLEM: agent_commission_unrecorded fired on all 11
-- agents with a total variance of 154,205.11 chips accrued-but-unrecorded for
-- the current week.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'eco_and_agent_commission_invariants'.
