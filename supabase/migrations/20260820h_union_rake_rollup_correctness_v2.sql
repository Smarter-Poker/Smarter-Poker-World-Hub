-- 2026-08-20 REVIEW ROUND 2 of 3 (applied via Supabase MCP as
-- 'union_rake_rollup_correctness_v2'). The rollup was silently WRONG.
--
-- Found by diffing the rollup against the legacy computation on a fixed
-- historical window: SHARK CLUB 489,066.11 (rolled) vs 489,205.40 (live).
-- Two independent causes:
--
-- CAUSE 1 — FINALIZED DAYS GO STALE. The rollup caches a query whose inputs
--   change retroactively: the union migration keeps setting tables.union_id
--   on EXISTING tables, so historical rake_records enter the union's scope
--   after the day was finalized. Measured: 2026-08-16 held 100,548 records
--   when rolled and 102,171 an hour later (+1,623); 08-17/18/19 likewise.
--   Every one of those records' rake was missing from the settlement basis,
--   under-crediting the club that earned it.
--
-- CAUSE 2 — ATTRIBUTION WAS BAKED IN. Rake was stored per CLUB, resolved at
--   refresh time. A player joining/leaving a club afterwards silently
--   changed the correct answer while the cache kept the old one.
--
-- FIX — the cache can now only ever be a SPEED optimization, never a
-- correctness input:
--   * Rake is stored PER USER per day (union_rake_paid_daily_user). Club
--     attribution and the horse filter are applied at READ time with exactly
--     the legacy expressions, so membership changes are picked up for free.
--   * Every day carries records_seen; a day whose live record count no
--     longer matches is treated as MISSING and recomputed live FOR THAT DAY
--     ONLY. A stale cache degrades speed, never accuracy.
--   * fn_union_rake_rollup_catchup re-validates recent days and re-rolls the
--     stale ones, outside any money transaction.
--
-- Verified after applying: fn_union_rake_paid_readonly == fn_union_rake_paid_live
-- to the cent in BOTH horse modes; and with the cache deliberately poisoned
-- (records_seen wrong AND rake_amount multiplied by 99) the reader still
-- returned the exact correct figure. 7-day call: 1.67s.
