-- Credit-risk invariants, folded into the existing governance sweep so the
-- engine sentinel (every 30 min) and the Monday PHASE 8 both pick them up
-- with no code change.
--
-- COST NOTE: the breach check is driven off union_club_terms rows that
-- actually have a stop_loss_limit set. Today none do, so the LATERAL never
-- executes and the check costs nothing (measured 0.016s). Cost scales only
-- with enforcement adoption, which is the right shape for a check that runs
-- every cycle.
--
-- Verified in a rolled-back transaction: with a 1,000,000 stop loss set on a
-- club sitting 4.57M down, fn_union_governance_check went from zero criticals
-- to `union_club_stop_loss_breached`, and a recorded 250,000 presettlement
-- reduced measured exposure by exactly 250,000.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'union_credit_risk_invariants'.
