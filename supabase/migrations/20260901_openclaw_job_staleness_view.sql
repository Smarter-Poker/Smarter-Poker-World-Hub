-- APPLIED TO PRODUCTION 2026-09-01 via Supabase MCP apply_migration
-- (name: 20260901_openclaw_job_staleness_view). Committed here for audit.

-- v_openclaw_job_staleness
--
-- WHY: on 2026-08-31 the Open Claw dispatcher's CRON_SECRET was rotated on
-- Vercel but not on the private workers VM. Every workers-routed job 401'd for
-- 25 hours (08:59:01 UTC -> 2026-09-01 17:21:17 UTC). Nothing noticed, because
-- a 401 is rejected by requireCronSecret BEFORE the cron_execution_log
-- middleware runs: the log does not fill with errors, it simply STOPS.
--
-- check-cron-liveness.mjs asks "ran >= 3 times and never succeeded" and cannot
-- see silence. check-cron-fleet-alive.mjs asks "has ANY job succeeded lately"
-- and cannot see ONE job going quiet while the fleet is noisy. This view is
-- the per-job member of that family.
--
-- The baseline is empirical (p90 of the gap between consecutive successes over
-- 30 days) rather than a hand-maintained schedule table, so it cannot drift
-- away from the dispatcher.
--
-- KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than hidden: a job that fires less often than
-- roughly weekly will not reach successes_30d >= 5 and therefore has no
-- baseline here. Monthly jobs (vip-diamond-stipend) are NOT covered by this
-- view. They remain covered by check-cron-liveness.mjs's "never succeeds" rule.
