-- APPLIED TO PRODUCTION 2026-08-30.
--
-- Two new checks in `economy_invariants`, the function CHECK 10 of the
-- Pre-Deploy Safety Checks calls. Both cover defects found and fixed the same
-- day in initialize_player_profile:
--
--  1. It granted the 500 diamond welcome bonus to profiles.diamonds alone,
--     leaving diamond_balance at its default 0. Every account it created was
--     born violating no_profiles_balance_drift - which turns red for the WHOLE
--     ESTATE, on whoever opens the next pull request, reading exactly like a
--     live currency defect. That is what it did that morning.
--
--  2. It allocated player_number with a raw NEXTVAL on a sequence that had
--     fallen behind the numbers already in use, instead of the canonical
--     fn_next_player_number() which loops until it finds a free one. It hit
--     uq_profiles_player_number, CAUGHT ITS OWN EXCEPTION, and returned
--     success=false in a result column - so profile creation failed with
--     nothing raised and nothing alerted.
--
-- no_profiles_balance_drift already existed and did catch (1) - but only AFTER
-- an affected account existed, and it names the symptom rather than the cause.
-- These name the cause, in the same run, before an account is made. Nothing
-- caught (2) at all.
--
-- Comments are stripped from prosrc before searching. The first attempt at the
-- allocator fix aborted on its own post-condition because the comment
-- EXPLAINING the fix mentioned the retired sequence. An assertion must read
-- code, never prose.
