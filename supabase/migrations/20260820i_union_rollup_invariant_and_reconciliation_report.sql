-- 2026-08-20 REVIEW ROUND 3 of 3 (applied via Supabase MCP as
-- 'union_rollup_invariant_and_reconciliation_report').
--
--  (a) A governance invariant so a rollup that stops being maintained is
--      visible BEFORE Monday rather than as a slow settlement. It is a
--      WARNING, not a correctness alarm: a stale day is recomputed live at
--      read time (see 20260820h), so the only cost is that the settlement
--      would do that work inline while holding treasury locks.
--
--  (b) fn_union_reconciliation_report — the read-only pre-Monday preview the
--      handoff asked for (P3-5). Shows exactly what the settlement would do,
--      including the residual and the tolerance the guard will apply,
--      WITHOUT writing anything or creating a temp table (the existing dry
--      run is VOLATILE and cannot be used from a report/RLS context).
--      Granted to authenticated so the union dashboard can render it.
