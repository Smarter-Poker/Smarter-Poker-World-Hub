-- A SERVER-SIDE WITNESS FOR A VERIFICATION THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE ACCOUNT
-- EXISTS. Added 2026-08-25. Applied to production the same day.
--
-- /auth/signup verifies the handset BEFORE calling supabase.auth.signUp, so
-- /api/sms/verify-otp has no session to write to. Its anonymous path therefore
-- returned success and wrote nothing at all, and ensure-profile took the
-- client's word for it: `phone_verified: metadata?.phone_verified === true`,
-- read straight out of user_metadata - which the account holder can set for
-- themselves with supabase.auth.updateUser({ data: { phone_verified: true } }).
-- The `=== true` strictness only rejected a truthy STRING; a genuine boolean
-- written by the user passed through untouched.
--
-- That disarmed the duplicate-phone guard in verify-otp, which only matches
-- profiles WHERE phone_verified = true. One handset, unlimited accounts, and
-- every one of them collecting a 500-diamond welcome package - the attack that
-- guard's own comment calls "the cheapest attack on the whole economy".
--
-- verify-otp now upserts a receipt the moment Twilio's code actually matches,
-- and ensure-profile confirms the claimed number against it (1 hour TTL, fails
-- closed: no receipt, or a read that errors, means not verified). Digits only,
-- matching `cleanPhone` in verify-otp.
