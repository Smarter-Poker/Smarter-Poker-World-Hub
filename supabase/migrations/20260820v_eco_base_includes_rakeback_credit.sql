-- ECO BASE CORRECTED (2026-08-20) — Dan:
--   "RAKE IS COUNTED AS PROFIT AS WELL, AS THEY ARE RECEIVING 90% OF THE RAKE
--    GENERATED BACK. ANY AND ALL RAKE GENERATED NETS A 90% INVOICE CREDIT."
--
-- My first version used settle_net alone as the base. settle_net already
-- contains 100% of the rake (settle_net = players_won + rake_generated),
-- because the rake leg is settled separately through the rake wallet. But the
-- club does not keep 100% of that rake — it receives 90% of it back as an
-- invoice credit, and the union keeps 10%. So the club's PROFIT OVERALL, which
-- is what ECO is charged on, is its settlement position PLUS that 90% credit:
--
--   eco_base = settle_net + (club_commission_rate x rake_generated)
--   eco      = -eco_rate x eco_base
--
-- which is precisely the `settled_in_chips` line already shown on
-- fn_union_club_invoice: player P&L settlement + rakeback credit. ECO is now
-- 10% of the club's actual net invoice position, so a club that ends the week
-- up pays 10% of that gain and a club that ends down is rebated 10% of that
-- loss — including, in both directions, the rake it generated at the 90% the
-- club actually receives.
--
-- The rakeback rate is read per club from union_clubs.club_commission_rate
-- (0.90 default) rather than hardcoded, so a club on a different deal is taxed
-- on the credit it actually gets.
--
-- Unchanged: ECO is an INVOICE ADJUSTMENT with no auto-distribution, it is
-- disabled by default, the rake schedule is untouched, and there are no late
-- fees.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'eco_base_includes_rakeback_credit'.
