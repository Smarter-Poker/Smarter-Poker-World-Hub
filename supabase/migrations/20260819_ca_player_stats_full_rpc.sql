-- 20260819_ca_player_stats_full_rpc.sql
-- Club Arena Player Stats rebuild (Tier 2 migration — additive only)
--
-- WHY: /hub/club-arena/stats showed "No Stats Yet" for everyone.
--   Root causes:
--   1. player_stats has ONE ROW PER CLUB per user; the page called
--      .maybeSingle() which errors on >1 row -> data=null -> empty state.
--   2. player_sessions is essentially unpopulated (3 rows total) while the
--      real source of truth (hand_history, 2.2M rows) was never queried.
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDS (no destructive changes, no data rewrites):
--   1. GIN index on hand_history.players (jsonb_path_ops) for @> lookups.
--      (Built CONCURRENTLY out-of-band on 2026-08-19; IF NOT EXISTS keeps
--      this migration idempotent.)
--   2. ca_player_stats_full(p_user uuid) RETURNS jsonb — SECURITY DEFINER
--      RPC that computes lifetime cash + tournament statistics directly
--      from hand_history + tournament_registrations:
--      totals, VPIP/PFR/3-bet/fold-to-3-bet/c-bet/AF/WTSD/WSD, profit,
--      bb/100, per-position stats, per-variant stats, daily series,
--      gap-clustered session history, tournament results (entries, ITM,
--      wins, ROI) and recent tournaments.
--
-- SECURITY: definer bypasses hand_history RLS but only returns aggregates
--   (never hole cards). EXECUTE granted to authenticated + service_role
--   only. Stats are club-visible by design (same as player_stats RLS).
--
-- ROLLBACK:
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.ca_player_stats_full(uuid, int);
--   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS public.idx_hand_history_players_gin;
