-- ECO — the union win tax / loss rebate (2026-08-20)
--
-- Dan's spec: winning clubs are taxed 10% of what they win; that money goes to
-- losing clubs as a rebate. Rake generated is "factored in somehow". It is an
-- INVOICE ADJUSTMENT — it changes what each club owes when squaring up with
-- the union each week. There is NO automatic chip distribution.
--
-- The published industry formula (Primetime Union charter) is:
--   "Tax/Rebate can be either negative or positive. It is -10% of your club's
--    winnings and rake from cash tables and -4% ... from MTT games.
--    Example: if your players won $5,000 and raked $1,000, the rebate will be
--    negative $600 and vice versa."
-- i.e. base = (players' winnings) + (rake generated), result signed, x rate,
-- sign inverted: a winner pays, a loser receives.
--
-- THAT BASE IS EXACTLY OUR settle_net. From the identity the settlement is
-- already built on and that our CI asserts:
--     realized_net + stack_delta = transfer_in - rake_paid
--     settle_net = realized_net + stack_delta + rake_paid = transfer_in
-- and the chips a club's players actually gained = realized_net + stack_delta
--                                                = settle_net - rake_paid.
-- Therefore  players_won + rake_generated = settle_net.
--
-- So ECO = -rate * settle_net, which
--   * automatically "factors in rake generated", as Dan described;
--   * is guaranteed consistent with the settlement, because it is a function
--     of the very number the settlement moves chips on — it can never drift;
--   * gives the right signs: settle_net > 0 (club's players won) => negative
--     ECO => the club pays; settle_net < 0 => positive ECO => the club is
--     rebated a share of its losses.
--
-- NOT zero-sum, by design: sum(settle_net) across clubs is the house residual
-- (horses/house are the counterparty), so the union nets a small difference.
-- fn_union_eco_adjustment reports that as union_net_eco so it is never hidden.
--
-- Rates live in unions.settings (no new infra, matches bbj_split /
-- union_rake_hold). DISABLED BY DEFAULT: eco_enabled must be set to true
-- deliberately. Nothing here changes the rake schedule and there are no late
-- fees anywhere in this migration.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'union_eco_win_tax_rebate'.
