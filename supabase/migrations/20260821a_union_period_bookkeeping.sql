-- CLOSING THE WEEKLY CYCLE (2026-08-20)
--
-- Two loose ends left the weekly cycle open:
--   1. ECO was computed on demand but never persisted, so an invoice issued
--      today could not be reproduced tomorrow once live data moved on. The
--      union_eco_not_recorded invariant flags this but nothing satisfied it.
--   2. union_presettlements.applied_settlement_id was never set by anything,
--      so a presettlement would offset the running balance forever instead of
--      being consumed by the settlement it paid for.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT PUT INSIDE fn_union_settle_player_pnl. ECO recording calls
-- the reconciliation report, which calls fn_union_pnl_all_clubs (~7s over a
-- week). Putting that inside the settlement transaction would add seven
-- seconds to a window holding FOR UPDATE locks on union_wallets and
-- clubs.chip_treasury, contending with live horse funding -- the same mistake
-- I already had to undo with the rake rollup. These run OUTSIDE the money
-- transaction: fn_union_eco_record_current_week is called by the engine
-- settler each cycle, and fn_union_apply_presettlements is called explicitly.
--
-- Verified end to end in a rolled-back transaction:
--   * with ECO enabled, union_eco_not_recorded fires BEFORE recording, and
--     fn_union_eco_record_current_week writes 2 ledger rows (one per club);
--   * a 75,000 presettlement shows on the invoice immediately;
--   * fn_union_apply_presettlements consumes a payment received DURING the
--     settled period (applied=1, total=50,000.00, none left unapplied) and
--     correctly does NOT consume one received after period_end.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'union_period_bookkeeping'.
