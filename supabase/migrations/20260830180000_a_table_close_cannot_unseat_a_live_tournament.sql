--  A TABLE CLOSE CANNOT UNSEAT A LIVE TOURNAMENT FIELD (Dan 2026-08-30)
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- APPLIED TO PRODUCTION 2026-08-30. This file is the record of that migration.
--
-- On 2026-08-30 the 20K GTD Sunday $200 Deep Stack seated 111 players across
-- 13 tables, dealt 79 hands, and then stopped dead. Every player saw a felt
-- with seated opponents, no cards, no button, and the word "Spectating".
--
-- The chain: the RETIRED World Hub legacy engine (GameController._recoverTables)
-- claimed the 13 brand-new tournament tables because its recovery query took the
-- 100 most recently created open tables with no tournament filter. Ten minutes
-- later _cleanupStaleTables closed each one as "stale and empty" -- empty being
-- true only of the legacy engine's own in-memory Table object, which never holds
-- the real players. This trigger then did what it says on the tin and released
-- every seat on every closed table: 111 seats stamped between 17:21:16 and
-- 17:21:58, one table at a time. Club Arena's loadSeatedPlayers ends
-- `.is('left_at', null)`, so the deal loop found zero active players and parked
-- in idle_not_enough_players forever.
--
-- THE LEGACY ENGINE IS SHUT OFF IN THE SAME CHANGE (GameController.js). This
-- migration exists because that fix is one writer and this is the shared
-- amplifier: EVERY path that can set a table's status to closed -- an admin
-- panel, auto-close-tables, a horse fleet shutdown, a future one nobody has
-- written yet -- reaches the whole field through this trigger. A seat release
-- should follow the GAME ending, not a row's status column changing while the
-- game is still being dealt.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES: exactly one condition. A table whose tournament is still live
-- keeps its seats. Everything else is untouched:
--
--   * a CASH table (tournament_id IS NULL) releases its seats exactly as before
--     -- that is the ordinary, correct behaviour and the vast majority of rows;
--   * a table belonging to a COMPLETED or CANCELLED tournament releases its
--     seats exactly as before;
--   * the tournament-finish path is unaffected and remains the right way to
--     empty a field -- trg_release_seats_on_tournament_finish and
--     fn_clear_table_seats fire on the tournament's own transition, which is
--     the event that genuinely means "these seats are over".
--
-- So this does not strand seats: it defers them to the ending that actually
-- ends the game. A tournament that finishes still clears every seat.
--
-- Table balancing is also unaffected -- it moves a player by writing left_at on
-- the specific seat row it is moving, never by closing a table underneath a
-- live field.
