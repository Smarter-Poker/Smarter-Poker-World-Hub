-- LATENT BUG: the invoice depended on which ECO base mode was selected
-- (2026-08-20, found in adversarial review of my own work).
--
-- fn_union_club_invoice recovered the settlement position by backing the
-- rakeback credit out of eco_base:
--     player_pnl_net := eco_base - (rake x rb_rate)
-- That is only correct while eco_base = settle_net + rakeback credit, i.e.
-- while eco_base_mode = 'net_invoice_position'. When I later made the base
-- configurable, switching mode silently corrupted the invoice. Measured on
-- Club JAQK, true settle_net -146,299.27:
--     net_invoice_position -> -146,299.27  (correct)
--     winnings_plus_rake   -> -172,323.62  (out by one rakeback credit)
--     winnings_only        -> -201,239.56  (out by rake + rakeback)
-- A configuration switch in one function silently changing the money on
-- another function's invoice is exactly the class of coupling that causes
-- disputes nobody can reproduce later.
--
-- FIX: reconstruct the settlement position from two values that are
-- mode-independent, using the identity the whole system already rests on:
--     settle_net = players_won + rake_generated
-- fn_union_eco_adjustment returns both regardless of mode (players_won is
-- always settle_net - rake_paid, rake_generated is always rake_paid), so the
-- invoice now needs no knowledge of how ECO chose its base -- and it costs no
-- extra query.
--
-- Verified after: all three modes return player_pnl_net = -146,299.27,
-- matching the reconciliation report exactly.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'invoice_independent_of_eco_base_mode'.
