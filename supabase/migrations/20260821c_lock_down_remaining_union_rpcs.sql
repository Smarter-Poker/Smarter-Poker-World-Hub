-- SWEEP: the rest of the fn_union_* family exposed to anon (2026-08-20)
--
-- Earlier today I locked six named union RPCs and noted that the
-- default-PUBLIC-EXECUTE trap applies to EVERY SECURITY DEFINER function
-- nobody explicitly revoked, and that a project-wide sweep was owed. A broad
-- check then found 24 fn_union_* functions still callable by `anon` -- i.e. by
-- anyone holding the publishable key, with no login.
--
-- Among them, SECURITY DEFINER + writes + NO auth check:
--   fn_union_integrity_sweep, fn_union_law_selftest
-- and financial readers wide open to anon:
--   fn_union_pnl_all_clubs (every club's P&L), fn_union_club_player_pnl
--   (per-player P&L), fn_union_commingling_report, fn_union_money_path_check,
--   fn_union_agent_coverage, fn_union_pnl_baseline, and the law/integrity
--   breach reports.
--
-- SAFETY CHECKS RUN FIRST, because a careless revoke here is an outage:
--   * fn_union_oversees_club is referenced by SIXTEEN RLS policies, including
--     the `tables` SELECT policy. Revoking it from authenticated would break
--     row-level security evaluation for every logged-in user and could hide
--     every table from every player. IT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT UNTOUCHED.
--   * fn_union_setting and fn_union_oversight_tables are SECURITY INVOKER
--     helpers, so an inner call runs as the invoking user. They keep
--     `authenticated` and lose only `anon`.
--   * fn_union_leaderboard_period_v2 is called from the browser
--     (LeaderboardService.ts) -- keeps `authenticated`, loses `anon`.
--   * fn_union_send_to_club_atomic and fn_union_club_player_pnl are called
--     only by World Hub API routes using the service-role key (supabaseAdmin),
--     so both are safe to close entirely.
--   * Functions carrying their own auth.uid() check (expel_club,
--     agent_risk_report, player_directory, weekly_agent_statements) keep
--     `authenticated` and lose `anon`.
--   * Every other function below has zero RLS references and only
--     SECURITY DEFINER callers, which run as the owner regardless of the
--     caller's grants.
--
-- Signatures were generated from pg_proc rather than typed by hand (my first
-- attempt guessed them and failed on fn_union_integrity_sweep).
--
-- VERIFIED AFTER APPLYING:
--   * the only fn_union_* still anon-callable is fn_union_oversees_club, by
--     design;
--   * fn_union_pnl_all_clubs is closed to authenticated;
--   * the leaderboard is still callable by logged-in users;
--   * the reconciliation report still runs for the service role;
--   * and the decisive one -- a normal logged-in player still sees 74 tables,
--     so RLS evaluation is intact.
