-- BUG FIX (2026-08-20, introduced minutes earlier by me and caught by
-- cross-checking the invoice against the ECO figures):
--
-- fn_union_club_invoice read `eco.eco_base` into its player_pnl_net column.
-- That was correct while eco_base meant settle_net. When the ECO base was
-- corrected to include the 90% rakeback credit, the invoice kept adding
-- rakeback_due on top of a base that already contained it — double-counting
-- the credit. Club JAQK showed settled_in_chips of -94,319.58 where the true
-- net invoice position was -120,324.51 (a 26,004.93 overstatement, exactly one
-- rakeback credit).
--
-- Fix: derive the settlement position back out of the base rather than
-- changing fn_union_eco_adjustment's signature (which has dependents):
--     eco_base   = settle_net + rakeback_credit
--  => settle_net = eco_base - rakeback_due
-- Since the invoice already computes rakeback_due with the same per-club rate,
-- this is exact. It also makes the identity explicit and self-checking:
--     settled_in_chips = settle_net + rakeback_due = eco_base
-- i.e. the club's net invoice position IS the ECO base, which is what Dan
-- described as "the profit the club makes overall". Verified on production:
-- identity_holds = true for both clubs after applying.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'fix_invoice_double_counting_rakeback'.
