-- 2026-08-20 re-audit: fn_union_rake_rollup_refresh_day divided by the
-- per-record contribution total with no guard. The legacy/live computation
-- filters `total_contrib > 0`; the finalizer did not. A single rake_records
-- row whose player_contributions sum to 0 would raise division_by_zero, the
-- day would never finalize, and -- because a non-finalized day is recomputed
-- live at read time -- it would silently fall back to the slow path forever
-- with no error surfaced anywhere.
--
-- None exist today (0 such rows in the last 7 days on union tables), so this
-- is pre-emptive. NULLIF makes the share NULL instead of raising, and the
-- existing `WHERE expanded.share IS NOT NULL` filter already drops it --
-- matching the live function's behaviour exactly. No change when the total is
-- positive: re-verified cent-equal to fn_union_rake_paid_live in both horse
-- modes after applying.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'rollup_refresh_day_guard_zero_contrib'.
