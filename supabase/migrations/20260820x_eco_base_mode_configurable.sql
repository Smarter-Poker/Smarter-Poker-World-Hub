-- ECO BASE MODE (2026-08-20) — outcome of a deep research pass on how real
-- PokerBros/PPPoker unions actually calculate the ecosystem tax.
--
-- FINDING: there is no single industry formula. Three different bases are
-- documented by credible sources, and they disagree by exactly the rake terms.
-- Rather than hardcode one, the base is now selectable per union.
--
--   1. 'net_invoice_position'  (DEFAULT — Dan's spec for this platform)
--        base = settle_net + club_commission_rate * rake_generated
--      The club's actual net position on the weekly invoice: its settlement
--      position plus the 90% rakeback credit it receives. Dan: "RAKE IS
--      COUNTED AS PROFIT AS WELL, AS THEY ARE RECEIVING 90% OF THE RAKE
--      GENERATED BACK. ANY AND ALL RAKE GENERATED NETS A 90% INVOICE CREDIT."
--      Self-checking: equals fn_union_club_invoice.settled_in_chips exactly.
--
--   2. 'winnings_plus_rake'    (Primetime Union published charter)
--        base = settle_net          [ = players_won + rake_generated ]
--      "Tax/Rebate can be either negative or positive. It is -10% of your
--       club's winnings and rake from cash tables and -4% ... from MTT games.
--       Example: If your players won $5,000 and raked $1,000 from cash games,
--       the rebate will be negative $600 and vice versa."
--      (5,000 + 1,000) * 10% = 600. Reproduced exactly by this implementation.
--      Note that union also runs a LOWER rate on tournaments (4%); we use a
--      single rate, see eco_rate.
--
--   3. 'winnings_only'         (Two Plus Two "guru of poker club apps" AMA)
--        base = settle_net - rake_generated   [ = players_won ]
--      Post #37: "Accountability is often provided through a tax/rebate
--       system. Each week, a percent of winnings is taken from each club and
--       given to losing clubs. In the long run this evens out to 0. Most of
--       the time, consistently winning clubs are just kicked."
--      That source states the base as winnings only, gives no percentage, and
--      gives no distribution rule.
--
-- Corroborated by the same AMA (post #1) and matching what we already built:
--   * "Union accounting is done on a weekly basis... A stop loss and security
--      deposit system is employed by the union to ensure accountability."
--   * "The union takes an amount (from 0-15%) of each club's weekly rake" —
--     our 10% sits inside that range.
--   * (post #55) the standard waterfall: "Union: takes 10% / Club owner: takes
--     90%" — exactly our 90/10 split.
--
-- Verified on production across all three modes for the live week:
--   net_invoice_position : JAQK base -120,317.34 eco +12,031.73
--   winnings_plus_rake   : JAQK base -146,325.67 eco +14,632.57
--   winnings_only        : JAQK base -175,223.81 eco +17,522.38
--
-- Unchanged: ECO is an INVOICE ADJUSTMENT with no auto-distribution, disabled
-- by default, rake schedule untouched, no late fees.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'eco_base_mode_configurable'.
