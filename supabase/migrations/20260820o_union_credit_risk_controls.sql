-- UNION CREDIT RISK CONTROLS (2026-08-20)
--
-- Researched against how production PokerBros/PPPoker unions actually
-- operate (e.g. the Primetime Union charter). Every real union runs on four
-- risk primitives that this platform had NONE of:
--
--   1. SECURITY DEPOSIT -- collateral the union holds per club. Returned only
--      when the club leaves. It is the union's only protection against a club
--      that loses more than it can pay.
--   2. STOP LOSS -- a weekly loss limit, conventionally equal to the security
--      deposit, reset at the start of each settlement week. When a club
--      crosses it the club is suspended until it settles. Without this a club
--      can run up an unbounded debt between Monday settlements.
--   3. PRESETTLEMENT -- money sent mid-week. It offsets the running balance AND
--      raises the stop-loss headroom 1:1, which is how a club keeps playing
--      after a bad run without the union extending free credit.
--   4. SETTLEMENT AGING -- a due date after the weekly statement (Wednesday in
--      most unions) and a late fee, so "unpaid" is a state with consequences
--      rather than a number that sits forever.
--
-- Our settlement moves chips atomically, so we cannot be left with an unpaid
-- invoice the way an off-platform union can -- but we CAN be left with a club
-- whose treasury is empty and whose players keep losing, which is the same
-- exposure wearing a different hat. `total_unpaid` on union_pnl_settlements
-- already records exactly that and nothing watches it.
--
-- Conservative by design: a club with no terms row, or a NULL stop_loss_limit,
-- is NOT enforced -- it is reported as "no terms on file". Nothing is
-- suspended automatically by this migration; it makes exposure VISIBLE and
-- alertable first. Enforcement is a policy decision for Dan.
--
-- First run against production revealed the point of the exercise: since the
-- Monday week start, SHARK CLUB was carrying 4,573,065.89 of unsettled
-- exposure and Club JAQK 146,315.66, against a 0 security deposit and no stop
-- loss -- a number nobody could see before.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'union_credit_risk_controls'.
