-- CLUB DATA SNAPSHOT -- the RPC behind the club owner's real-time data screen.
--
-- Cash figures come from club_table_daily (see
-- 20260822213000_club_table_daily_rollup.sql): expanding rake attribution live
-- over a fourteen-day window was measured and does not finish inside the
-- statement timeout. Tournament and spin figures are computed live because
-- that volume is small (~13k rake rows a week vs 638k for cash).
--
-- SIGNS: total_winnings is the PLAYERS' net. Negative means the club's players
-- lost, which is the club winning -- the same convention the reference screen
-- uses. fee is rake generated, always positive.
--
-- GATE: ca_can_view_club_finances -- owner / admin / super_agent of the club,
-- or a platform admin. Deliberately stricter than ca_can_view_club, which lets
-- any member in; this returns club money.
--
-- This file carries the FINAL definition, i.e. it already includes the fix
-- applied minutes later as 'ca_club_data_snapshot_scope_tournaments_to_club':
-- the first cut attributed tournament and spin rows to the whole UNION rather
-- than to the club being viewed, so Club JAQK's screen showed SHARK CLUB's
-- tournament fees and winnings too (mtt_winnings read +135,588.09 against a
-- real figure of +3,917.61). Cash rows were always correct -- they come from
-- club_table_daily, which is keyed by member club. After the fix, JAQK's
-- 345.76 plus SHARK's 12,959.82 equals the union's 13,305.58 exactly.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as 'ca_club_data_snapshot' and
-- 'ca_club_data_snapshot_scope_tournaments_to_club'.
