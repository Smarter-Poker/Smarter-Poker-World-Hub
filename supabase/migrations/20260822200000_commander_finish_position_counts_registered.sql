-- commander_claim_finish_position counted a different field than it eliminated.
--
-- APPLIED TO PRODUCTION 2026-08-22 via the Supabase MCP before this file was
-- committed, and verified in a rolled-back transaction: the first bust in the
-- 12-handed "Friday Night $150 NLH - Verification" now returns place 12 with
-- 11 remaining. Before the fix it returned place 1.
--
-- THE ASYMMETRY
--   COUNT : status IN ('seated','active','bagged')                -- no 'registered'
--   UPDATE: status IN ('registered','seated','active','bagged')   -- 'registered' allowed
--
-- A 'registered' entry could therefore be busted while never having been
-- counted as part of the field. The place handed out is derived from that
-- count, and payouts are derived from the place.
--
-- WHY THIS WAS NOT THEORETICAL
-- Rooms seat and start their events while entries are still 'registered':
-- production held 53 such rows, 52 of them sitting on a table and seat, and
-- SIX RUNNING TOURNAMENTS had a counted field of ZERO because every one of
-- their players was 'registered'. In that state v_remaining is 0, the clamp
-- lifts it to 1, and THE FIRST PLAYER ELIMINATED IS RECORDED IN 1ST PLACE.
-- The second bust then collides on uq_commander_entries_finish_position and
-- raises 23505, which eliminate.js surfaces as a failed elimination - so the
-- event could not be played out at all.
--
-- Even with a partly-seated field the numbering walks: busting one no-show in
-- a field of 5 seated players issues place 5 to the no-show, leaving 5 live
-- players to share places 4..1, so the last one out takes 1st - which the
-- winner branch then cannot write.
--
-- THE FIX
-- Count the same set the UPDATE is willing to eliminate. That is also the
-- definition of field size used everywhere else: register.js counts
-- ('registered','seated','active','bagged') against max_entries.
--
-- 'bagged' stays counted (alive, chips in a bag); 'alternate' stays out (not
-- in the field yet); eliminated/cancelled/winner stay out.
--
-- Parameter order is (p_entry_id, p_tournament_id, p_eliminated_by) and is
-- preserved exactly - CREATE OR REPLACE cannot rename or reorder them.
--
-- ROLLBACK: restore the count to
--   AND e.status IN ('seated','active','bagged')
-- Signature and return shape are unchanged either way.
