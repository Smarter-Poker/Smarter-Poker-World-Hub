-- RETRACTING MY OWN FALSE ALARM (2026-08-20)
--
-- Earlier today I reported "all 11 agents have commission accrued but never
-- recorded — 154,205.11 chips of variance" and shipped an invariant
-- (agent_commission_unrecorded) plus per-player commission columns to expose
-- it. THAT FINDING WAS WRONG. There is no missing money.
--
-- The error: `agent_commissions.user_id` is the AGENT who EARNED the
-- commission, not the player who generated the rake. Reading the writer
-- (credit_agent_commission_from_rake) makes it explicit:
--     INSERT INTO agent_commissions (club_id, user_id, ...)
--     VALUES (COALESCE(v_book_club, p_club_id), v_agent_user_id, ...)
-- I joined that column as if it were the player, so every per-player lookup
-- found nothing and the whole roster looked unpaid.
--
-- Proof it is correctly recorded: 26 distinct users were credited this week
-- and ALL 26 are agents; the super_agent I cited as having "zero credited"
-- was in fact credited 6,337.59 for the week, matching the 6,330.32 its own
-- aggregate statement reported (the small delta is elapsed time between the
-- two reads). Total credited this week: 83,533.70.
--
-- Why no replacement invariant: commission is a WATERFALL, not a flat rate.
-- The direct agent earns rake x own_rate; the parent super-agent then earns
-- (rake - direct) x parent_rate; and the row is booked to the PLAYER's
-- resolved club (fn_resolve_player_club_for_agent), which need not equal the
-- agent's own club_id. So neither "rake x commission_rate" nor "row rate ==
-- agents.commission_rate" is a valid expectation — I tested the latter and it
-- flagged 187,258 of 187,258 rows, i.e. another false positive. A false alarm
-- on money is worse than no alarm, so the check is REMOVED rather than
-- replaced with a third guess. If commission assurance is wanted later it
-- needs to model the waterfall explicitly, which is a piece of work in its
-- own right.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'retract_false_agent_commission_alarm'. Verified after: governance returns
-- only the legitimate union_club_no_terms warning, and the agent aggregate
-- statement still reports commission_earned correctly.

-- 1. Remove the bad invariant, keeping the three sound ones.
