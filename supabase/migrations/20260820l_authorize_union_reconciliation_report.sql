-- SEC-2 (2026-08-20): fn_union_reconciliation_report -- which I added earlier
-- today -- was executable by PUBLIC, i.e. by `anon`, i.e. by anyone with the
-- project's publishable key and no login at all. It is SECURITY DEFINER and
-- takes an arbitrary p_union_id, so it exposed every union's full financial
-- position: buy-ins, cash-outs, realized net, seated stacks, rake, and the
-- exact amount each club owes or is owed. GRANTing it to `authenticated` did
-- not remove the default PUBLIC grant.
--
-- Fix: revoke PUBLIC/anon, and authorize INSIDE the function so it stays
-- usable by the union dashboard. A caller may read a union's reconciliation
-- only if they are the service role (auth.uid() IS NULL), the union owner, a
-- union admin, or an owner/admin/super_agent of a member club -- matching the
-- authorization the engine's admin handler uses for union-owned tables.
--
-- Applied to production via Supabase MCP as
-- 'authorize_union_reconciliation_report'.
