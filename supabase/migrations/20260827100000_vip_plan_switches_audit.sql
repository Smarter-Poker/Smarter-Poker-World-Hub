-- Audit trail for VIP plan changes (issue #771 item 6, built 2026-08-27).
--
-- The VIP FAQ promised a prorated credit on upgrade and there was no route
-- behind it: `stripe.subscriptions.update` appeared exactly once in this repo
-- (the cancellation) and `proration_behavior` appeared nowhere at all.
-- pages/api/store/switch-vip-plan.js is that route. This table records what
-- was switched and what the resulting invoice looked like, so a billing
-- question months later has an answer that does not depend on reading
-- Stripe's event log.
--
-- NOT AUTHORITATIVE STATE. profiles.is_vip / vip_tier / vip_expires_at and
-- the vip_subscriptions tier are owned by the Stripe webhook
-- (customer.subscription.updated), which fires on exactly this change. A
-- second writer racing the webhook is the defect shape this estate keeps
-- paying for, so this is an audit row and nothing more.
--
-- Applied to production 2026-08-27 via the Supabase MCP as
-- `vip_plan_switches_audit`.
