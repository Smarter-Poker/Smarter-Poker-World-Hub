 * 2. Background notifications via MasterBus postMessage
 *
 * Cache strategy:
 * - JS/CSS files with content hashes (e.g., HomePage-abc123.js) → Cache-first
 *   These files are immutable (hash changes on content change), so cache-first
 *   is safe and gives instant loads on re-entry from the World Hub.
 * - Images → Stale-while-revalidate (show cached, update in background)
 * - HTML/API → Network-first (always fresh)

/**
 * CACHE-FIRST navigation, revalidated in the background.
 *
 * 2026-08-24 — this was network-first with a 3.5s deadline, and that deadline
 * was being paid by every single entry into Club Arena. Tapping the tile in
 * the World Hub blocked on a full HTML round trip to Vercel before one byte of
 * the app could start, even though a byte-identical shell was already sitting
 * in this cache from install. On a phone that is 300-800ms of nothing, and it
 * is the first thing the player experiences.
 *
 * The shell is now returned from cache immediately — no network in the
 * critical path at all — and a fresh copy is fetched alongside it to update
 * the cache for next time.
 *
 * WHY A STALE SHELL IS SAFE HERE, which is the whole question:
 *
 *  - The shell and the exact hashed chunks it references are precached
 *    TOGETHER, in the same deploy-versioned cache, by the install handler
 *    below. A cached shell can therefore always resolve its own scripts from
 *    cache-first even after the server has rotated to new filenames.
 *  - trimCache above will not evict that set, which is what would otherwise
 *    break this the moment a session touched 400 chunks.
 *  - A new deploy ships a new sw-bus.js (DEPLOY_TS changes), so the browser
 *    installs a new SW, precaches the NEW shell + chunks, skipWaiting()s and
 *    claims. The following navigation serves the new shell. One extra
 *    navigation of latency on a deploy, in exchange for removing a round trip
 *    from every navigation.
 *  - When the background revalidation shows the shell has changed under a
 *    still-current SW, clients are told, so the app can refresh itself at a
 *    moment of its own choosing rather than mid-hand (see SHELL_UPDATED).
 *
 * ── THE BOUNDED FRESHNESS RACE (Dan 2026-08-29) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pure cache-first had a visible cost Dan ordered stopped: open Club Arena
 * right after a deploy (which, at this repo's deploy cadence, is MOST opens)
 * and the app boots the one-deploy-old shell, then SHELL_UPDATED lands and
 * useShellUpdateGate hard-reloads the page seconds after it painted. Dan:
 * "it like glitches and reloads... it looks like broken code."
 *
 * So the revalidation fetch — which was already being made on every
 * navigation — is now given a short, fixed budget to answer BEFORE the
 * cached shell is returned. If the network wins, the session boots the
 * CURRENT shell and there is nothing to reload later: no glitch at all.
 * If the budget expires first, the cached shell is served exactly as
 * before and the gate remains the (verified) fallback.
 *
 * This is NOT the 2026-08-24 network-first regression coming back:
 *  - the deadline is SHELL_FRESH_RACE_MS, not 3500ms, and on expiry the
 *    answer is the instant cached shell, never a spinner;
 *  - offline rejects the fetch immediately, so the offline path costs ~0ms;
 *  - the request was already on the wire for revalidation — the race adds
 *    no network traffic, only a bounded wait for work already in flight.

    // bug. A default fetch for a response still inside its freshness window
    // never reaches the server, and these paths are served
    // `Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000`. So the background half was a
    // no-op for THIRTY DAYS, and MEDIA_CACHE is not versioned, so a file
    // replaced at the same path was invisible to every returning player,
    // indefinitely.
    //
    // Measured on production 2026-08-28: the satellite icon had been
    // replaced twice and shipped correctly both times. A `fetch` from inside
    // the page with `cache: 'reload'` still returned the ORIGINAL 19,441-byte
    // artwork, because `cache: 'reload'` bypasses the HTTP cache but not this
    // service worker. curl, which has neither, got the new bytes. Two clients
    // on one machine seeing different images is what sent us looking here.
    //
    // THE FIX IS TWO PARTS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING:
    //
    // 1. `cache: 'no-cache'` on the background request. That forces a
    //    CONDITIONAL request — the browser sends If-None-Match with the
    //    stored ETag — so the server actually gets asked. Unchanged media
    //    answers 304 with no body, which is a few hundred bytes, not the
    //    image. This is the line that makes the word "revalidate" true.
    //
    // 2. A 6-hour floor before we bother. Without it, part 1 would put a
    //    conditional request on the wire for EVERY image on EVERY page view —
    //    roughly 120 of them on a table, on a phone, on cellular — to
    //    discover that ~all of them are unchanged. Below the floor we return
    //    the cached copy and touch the network zero times, exactly as before.
    //
    // So a media file replaced at a stable path now reaches everyone within
    // one revalidation window instead of never. That is a repair, not a
    // licence: version the FILENAME when you replace artwork you need people
    // to see immediately (`satellite-winner-v3.png`, `btn-hamburger-v4.png`),
    // because a new URL is correct on the very first paint and this is only
    // correct on the next one.
    //
    // `event.waitUntil` keeps the worker alive for the background half. We
    // have already handed the page a response by then, and without it the
    // browser is free to kill the worker mid-write and the cache never
    // updates — which would leave this looking fixed while behaving exactly
